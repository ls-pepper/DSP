The file includes demo examples,
revealing the subtle points of such a field of knowledge as Digital Processing
signals. The issues of building signal spectra, frequency selection
reports, the formation of digital filters, the visualization of their frequency and
impulse response. Discrete properties are also demonstrated.
Fourier transform associated with adding reports to a signal or spectrum, or
decimation. Autocorrelation functions and benefits are considered.
optimal filter for the selection of pulses in Gaussian noise.
